  <h1>Manta Rays</h1>

  <p>
    Manta Rays are some of the ocean's coolest creatures. Despite the drastic difference in their appearance from sharks and other fish, they are in fact close relatives of sharks. Like many stingrays, manta rays have very large pectoral fins that they flap to propel themselves, making them look like they are flying through the water. Mantas are known to many divers as one of the ocean's friendly giants. It is not uncommon for a manta to approach a diver and unlike stingrays, mantas do not have a deadly barb on their tail, but despite their friendly demeanor, manta populations are on the decline. Mantas tend to get captured in fishing nets and killed along with many other fish and they are also hunted for their tails and mandibles to be used in herbal medicine. So learn about them while you can! Here's some info about mantas!
