  <h2>An Introduction to Manta Rays</h2>

  <p class="text">
    Manta Rays are some of the ocean's coolest creatures. Despite the drastic difference in their appearance from sharks and other fish, they are in fact close relatives of sharks. Like many stingrays, manta rays have very large pectoral fins that they flap to propel themselves, making them look like they are flying through the water. Mantas are known to many divers as one of the ocean's friendly giants. It is not uncommon for a manta to approach a diver and unlike stingrays, mantas do not have a deadly barb on their tail, but despite their friendly demeanor, manta populations are on the decline. Mantas tend to get captured in fishing nets and killed along with many other fish and they are also hunted for their tails and mandibles to be used in herbal medicine. So learn about them while you can! Here's some info about mantas!

  There are several different species of manta ray that grow to varying sizes. But the largest manta rays are known to achieve a wingspan of 25 feet and weigh upwards of 5,000 lbs! But most mantas are usually around 20 feet in wingspan and weigh around 2,000 or 3,000 lbs.

  Mantas can be found in the three major oceans: Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. They tend to live near coasts and coastal reefs where food is more plentiful. Some of the more popular areas to find manta rays include Hawaii, Australia's Great Barrier Reef and Maldives.

  Despite their menacing size, mantas are as friendly as can be. They are actually filter feeders and only eat microscopic plankton. So, no need to worry about getting eaten!

    P.S. Here's a <a href="http://www.mantaray-world.com/">link</a> to another website similar to this one. This website is a good one because it is well organized and there are sections with different kinds of information and images. Also the background is not a plain white background which makes it look nicer. The website is simple, but it isn't plain, which is what makes it good.
